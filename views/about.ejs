                I'm a full-stack developer with a bachelor's degree in Software
                Engineering. I hold a strong belief that technology can
                positively impact people's lives. In a world where technology is
                omnipresent, failing to harness its capabilities is
                inconceivable. So, I help people build products, features, and
                websites that facilitate their lives. I translate vision into
                code. Feel free to contact me if you have any projects. I'll be
                happy to help you out. Whether it's a web or mobile application,
                you can count on me be your go-to person. <br />
                Beyond my tech-driven aspirations, I spent my days doting my cat
                companions, who have gracefully claimed me as their own üòÅ. And
                I am also a huge music lover with a diverse musical palette that
                spans from the catchy rhythms of "Who Made You God" by Chelsea
                Collins to the haunting depth of "You Want It Darker" by Leonard
                Cohen, journeying through the iconic hits of "Believe" by Cher
                and the soulful melancholy of "Creep" by Radiohead.
